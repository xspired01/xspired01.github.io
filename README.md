// initial files for NFL team win projector. Based on the Bill James' Pythagorean Theorem of Baseball that points scored and // points allowed provide a better indicator of a team's performance than Win-Loss percentage. Provides a baseline performance //and doesn't take into account injuries, coaching changes, player turn-over (draft, retirement, trades, free agency, etc), //and other modifiers.
